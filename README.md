### Overview

In this workshop you will learn about polygonal geometry, and the internal data
structures that represent the _shape_ of three-dimensional objects, often known
as *meshes*. To begin, clone this repository and open it in Unity as shown last
week. You'll be working with the following assets today:

* **MainScene.unity** - The scene you should open and work with for the entire
  workshop.
* **GenerateCube.cs** - A custom component that generates a cube mesh when the
"game" starts.
* **VertexColorShader.shader** - A Cg/HLSL shader used to render the cube using
simple vertex colours. Don't worry about understanding this file in detail
today -- you'll learn more about shaders later in the semester.
* **VertexColorMaterial.mat** - A material asset that utilises the above shader
to draw the cube's surface.

### Tasks

#### 1. Explore the scene

Open `MainScene.unity` in the editor. Press the ‘Play’ button and you should
see a *partially* rendered cube. Switch to the ‘Scene’ tab so you can manually
[navigate the scene](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html).
Use the ‘scene gizmo’ located in the top-right of the viewport in order to
select different angles to view the cube from. Which two faces are missing?

> [!NOTE]
> You might notice this cube is not visible except during play mode. This is
> because the cube mesh is *generated* upon starting the scene. This is done
> inside the `GenerateCube.cs` component, which you'll modify shortly.

#### 2. Turn on culling

Open `VertexColorShader.shader`, remove the code `Cull Off`, and save the file.
Make sure you keep this code removed for the remainder of the workshop. Examine
the cube again in the Unity editor. What did `Cull Off` do?

#### 3. Complete the cube

Add vertex definitions to `GenerateCube.cs` to complete the cube (add the
missing faces). Culling is now on, so make sure you use the correct vertex
*winding order* such that the triangles you define are visible from the outside
of the cube. Don't forget to also add corresponding vertex colour definitions,
which you should set to `Color.blue`.

#### 4. Create a pyramid

In a file called `GeneratePyramid.cs`, write a component that generates an
upward facing square pyramid. The tip of the pyramid should be located at
`(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)`, and each face should have a unique
[colour](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.html) of your choosing.
This will be very similar logically to the cube generator script, so you are
welcome to use it as a template. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Writing the new component alone is not sufficient to render the pyramid. You
> also need to attach it to a new game object with two other built-in
> components:
> * A [Mesh Filter](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshFilter.html)
> component that will be populated with the generated mesh when the game starts. 
> * A [Mesh Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html)
> component to actually draw the object. Recall from last week that a
> _material_ is associated with the mesh renderer to define how the object's
> surface should be drawn. In this case, you'll want to assign the existing
> `VertexColorMaterial.mat` asset so that vertex colour definitions in your
> *mesh* are utilised as part of the rendering process.

If you are stuck, you might find it helpful to use the existing **Cube** game
object as a guide! Remember that the mesh filter/renderer combination is
incredibly common in Unity, as most objects have a shape (`MeshFilter`), and
there needs to be a way of describing the surface of that shape before it can
be drawn (`MeshRenderer` with an assigned *material*). You might notice that
the mesh filter not just represents the shape but also contains colour data,
and that seemingly contradicts this notion. However this is just per-vertex
_data_ -- it is the mesh renderer, and ultimately the corresponding shader,
which *interprets* this data as actual colours that should be drawn. Another
material might interpret vertex "colours" in an entirely different way, or
ignore them altogether. If this is confusing, don't worry! You'll learn more
about shaders and materials in a few weeks.

#### 5. Reverse the vertex winding order

Move the scene view camera _inside_ the cube. Since back-face culling is on,
you won’t be able to see the inside faces of the cube. Modify the indices in
`GenerateCube.cs` so that you can see the interior of the cube instead of the
exterior. Carefully read the associated code comments as these provide some
more context about what the indices actually represent (the indices are defined
in step 3, near the end of the file). Can you think of another way to do this
that doesn't involve changing the indices?

#### 6. Generate a cone (challenge)

Constructing meshes by manually defining vertices/colours is tedious and rarely
done in practice (phew!). So far we've only asked you to do this so that you
understand the internal data structures required to define a mesh. Nonetheless,
the ability to generate a mesh using C# scripting is far from useless if we
want to _procedurally generate_ a mesh that is parameterised in some way.

For an extra challenge, try to write a script to procedurally generate a cone.
Use serialized (or public) class attributes to allow parameters of the cone to
be set from the editor, such as the radius. Hint: You can think of a cone as a
generalisation of the pyramid you manually defined in this workshop. The
vertices of the base will form a _circle_ rather than a square, and there’ll be
one vertex for the tip. [Maths
functions](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.html) like
`Mathf.Sin` and `Mathf.Cos` should help.

#### 7. Search for and import a 3D model (extension)

In practice, there are artists in a game dev team who use [3D
modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling) tools to design _models_
in the scene ([Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is worth checking out if you
are interested in trying this for yourself). These can be saved using various
file formats, many of which can be directly imported by the Unity engine as
pre-fabricated game objects. This means writing code to define the shape of an
object is not necessary at all! 

> [!NOTE] 
> A model can consist of more than just a mesh -- for example, surface
> properties (materials) and animations can be included. How these are
> represented in Unity depends on the file format and the respective Unity
> importer settings.

As a final extension exercise, search the web for some models and try to
[import them](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ImportingModelFiles.html) into
your Unity project. Models with the _.fbx_ format are generally well handled by
Unity, but there are other formats work well too. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind copyright and licensing when including external resources in
> your projects. There are many freebies out there, but licenses may prohibit
> usage under certain circumstances (this is likely only relevant if you plan
> to distribute your game).

Remember, it's a great idea to challenge yourself beyond what we explicitly
discuss in class. For example, see if you can import a model, but then also
"distort" it in some way by accessing the underlying mesh in a C# script (e.g.
modify the vertex definitions). You may need to do some additional research in
order to do this, but the building blocks of mesh data structures have been
demonstrated in this class. 

Feel free to reach out on Ed if you have any questions, and most importantly,
have fun!
